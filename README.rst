A RESTful API service for scheduling interactive and non-interactive (batch) jobs in a computer cluster. The service
facilitates the communication with the cluster job scheduler by providing a simple and clean interface that abstracts
the complexity that is typically involved when dealing with a cluster scheduler. The 2 most common operations pertaining
job scheduling are job composition and submission (``qsub``) and querying a job for its status (``qstat``).

The service currently supports ``OpenPBS`` and ``PBSPro`` as a job scheduler.

Setup üîß
========
The application can run in several ways, depending on what the target platform is.
One can run it directly on the system with ``python`` or get it running on a
``kubernetes`` cluster.

Python
------
The project uses `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`__ for dependency management
. Therefore to set up the project (recommended):

.. code-block:: bash

    # ensure poetry is installed
    $ poetry env use python3
    $ poetry install

That will configure a virtual environment for the project and install the respective
dependencies, which is particular useful during development stage.

Kubernetes
----------
Refer to `README <.kustomization/README.rst>`__ under ``.kustomization/``.

Configuration üìÑ
----------------
Since the project can read properties from the environment, one can use an ``.env``
file for application configurations. These should be set accordingly for a correct
service usage.

A possible configuration is:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Application context
    APPLICATION_CONTEXT=/api/jobsched/v1

    # version of OpenAPI
    OPENAPI=3.0.3


Note ‚ö†Ô∏è: one should use ``configmap`` and ``secret`` instead when configuring it for
``kubernetes``.

Run üöÄ
======
For a quick run with ``Flask``, run it like:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ poetry run flask run

Configure ``flask`` environments with environment variables or in a ``.flaskenv`` file.

``Flask`` uses ``Werkzeug`` which is a ``WSGI`` library intended for development
purposes. Do not use it in production! For a production like environment, one should
use instead a production server, like ``gunicorn``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ poetry run gunicorn src.app:create_app

Tests & linting üö•
==================
Run tests with ``tox``:

.. code-block:: bash

    # ensure tox is installed
    $ tox

Run linter only:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tox -e lint

Optionally, run coverage as well with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tox -e coverage
